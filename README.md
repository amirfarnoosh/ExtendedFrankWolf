# Extended In-face Frank-Wolfe

This is a robust and easy-to-use MATLAB implementation of [An Extended Frank-Wolfe Method with "In-Face" Directions, and its Application to Low-Rank Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02204) (see `IF_FW_SVD_update.m`)

* Run `Demo.m`, and `Demo_picture.m` for two examples.
